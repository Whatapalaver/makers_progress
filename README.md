Makers - Coding Progress
========================

I'm part of the July 2018 cohort at Makers bootcamp.  
I thought it would be useful to document the key progress points through the 12 weeks.


Week 7
------

By the end of week 7 all developers can:

- Build a front-end app in Javascript
- Work competently in Javascript
- Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

### In-week Pairing project - [Notes App](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/vanilla_notes)  
*We were focussing on vanilla javascript this week so started by recreating our own testing framework. Mine doesn't quite rival Jasmine but I learned quite a lot of fundamental syntax by experimenting with a number of testing methods.*

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [News Summary App](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/news-summary-challenge)  


Week 6
------

By the end of the week 6 developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### In-week Group project - [AirBnB Clone](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/Air_BnB_Clone)  
*This was an opportunity for us to work in a team of 4, using a stack of our choice (all completely new - JS, node, express, PG - tested with Jasmine and Cypress). Their were multiple technical challenges for us to overcome such as testing asynchronous calls to a database, automating database setup with Jake, amongst many others, but there was also the fascinating challenge of working with new people. Practising communication using an Agile framework and dealing with areas of conflict as they arose.*

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Bowling Scorer](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/bowling-challenge)  
*This was a particularly tricky challenge as the logic behind ten pin bowling is deceptively complex. I initially went down the route of manintaing a frame and roll history that worked very well until I had to handle the final frame scoring. At that point my code expanded to about double the original lines and I decided there must be a more efficient route. Enter Uncle Bob and the bowling kata. Two solutions are presented in the repo.*

Week 5
------

By the end of week 5 all developers can:

- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript  
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language 

### In-week Pairing project - [Thermostat](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/js_thermostat)

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Bowling Scorer](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/bowling-challenge)

Week 4
------

By the end of week 4 all developers can:

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

### In-week Pairing project - [Bookmark Manager](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/bookmark_manager)

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Chitter (a Twitter clone)](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/chitter-challenge)

Week 3
------

By the end of week 3 all developers can:

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

### In-week Pairing project - [Battle Multiplayer Web Game](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/battle)

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Rock, Paper, Scissors Web Game](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/rps-challenge)

Week 2
------

By the end of week 2 all developers can:

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)  
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage  
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking  
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change) . 
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback  

### Weekly Pairing Project - [Oyster Card](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/oyster_card)

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Takeaway Challenge](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/takeaway-challenge)

Week 1
------

By the end of week 1 all developers can:

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP 

### Weekly Pairing Project - [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/boris_bikes)

### Weekend Solo Challenge - [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/Whatapalaver/airport_challenge)
